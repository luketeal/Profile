# Profile

This is my [web designer portfolio](https://luketeal.github.io/Profile/).  

It currently has three project links to work I've done using HTML, CSS, and Scratch as well as an about me and a contact info section.

The project uses HTML and CSS as a codebase.

## Repository Contents
The repository includes

* The [html](./index.html) code;
* The [CSS Normalize](./Assets/css/styles.css) code to create uniformity across browsers;
* The [CSS](./Assets/css/styles.css) code; and
* The [images](./Assets/images).

## Objectives

The primary goal for this website is for it to be responsive to screensize and provide relevant information on my current work.
